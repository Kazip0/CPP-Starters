// constants, manipulato0rs and operators precedence

/*
Constant command/function fixes the Data values to stay the same every time 
a program is executed

Manipulators are operators used in C++ for formatting output. The data is 
manipulated by the programmerâ€™s choice of display.


Operator precedence
The order in which the mathematical operation is conducted in the program is called
operator precedence i.e. BODMAS
